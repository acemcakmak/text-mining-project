# XB_0085 Text Mining for AI Project

---

## üìå Overview

This repository showcases the final coursework for **XB_0085 Text Mining for AI**, completed at Vrije University in Spring 2024.

The project explores three core NLP tasks ‚Äî **Sentiment Analysis**, **Topic Analysis**, and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** ‚Äî by applying both classical machine learning and modern transformer-based models.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Components


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis

**Goal:**  
Classify text data into bipolar (positive/negative) or tripolar (positive/neutral/negative) sentiments.

**Methods Used:**  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier (MNB):** Using `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer` from `scikit-learn`.  
- **VADER:** Initially tested but omitted from final metrics due to lower comparative performance.

**Experiments:**  
- **5 main experiments:**  
  - 2 bipolar (subjective/objective & positive/negative)
  - 3 tripolar (positive/neutral/negative)  
- `min_df` tuned from 1‚Äì20 for feature selection.  
- Best test accuracy: **0.7** on 30,000 balanced tweets (10,000 per sentiment).  
- Word clouds visualized frequent tokens for each sentiment.

**Key Observations:**  
- High precision for negative and neutral predictions.
- False positives mainly occurred due to overlapping tokens across sentiment classes.
- Limited neutral-labeled data restricted model performance.
- Data balance and larger training sets are crucial for higher accuracy.

**Datasets:**  
- [Cornell Movie Review Polarity Dataset](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data)
- [Cornell Subjectivity Dataset](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data)
- [Twitter Sentiment Dataset (3 Million Tweets)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prkhrawsthi/twitter-sentiment-dataset-3-million-labelled-rows)
- [Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Topic Analysis

**Goal:**  
Categorize text data by topics ‚Äî Books, Movies, Sports.

**Methods Used:**  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB):** Probabilistic, assumes feature independence.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Margin-based classifier, robust for high-dimensional data.

**Datasets:**  
- [Amazon Book Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/amazon-book-reviews-webscraped)
- [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
- [FIFA World Cup Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumari2000/fifa-world-cup-twitter-dataset-2022)
- [European Football Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eliasdabbas/european-football-soccer-clubs-tweets)

**Results:**  
- **MNB:** High accuracy for Movies (~99%), limited by lower Book data.
- **SVM:** Outperformed MNB overall ‚Äî up to 100% on test data with slight f1-score drop for Books.
- Richer sports datasets improved topic detection for SVM more than MNB.

**Challenges:**  
- Underrepresented Book data hindered overall balance.
- Future improvements: expand Book-related data, adjust class weights, enhance data quality.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Named Entity Recognition (NER)

**Goal:**  
Extract entities (e.g., PERSON, LOCATION, DATE, WORK_OF_ART) from text.

**Methods Used:**  
- **BERT:** Pre-trained on CoNLL-2003 dataset; 4 entity types.
- **Flair:** Pre-trained on OntoNotes 5.0; 18 entity types.

**Results:**  
- **BERT:** Accuracy ~0.87 ‚Äî better performance but limited label set (mislabels extra categories as MISC).
- **Flair:** Broader entity coverage ‚Äî accuracy ~0.78 ‚Äî slightly lower due to tokenization edge cases and missing IOB tagging in raw output.

**Key Insights:**  
- BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism improved results despite label gaps.
- Flair's pre-trained extended label set gave it an edge on uncommon entities (DATE, WORK_OF_ART).
- Better token handling and additional fine-tuning could close performance gaps.

**Pre-trained Models:**  
- [Flair NER Model](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-ontonotes-large)
