Volatile week ahead in $SPX if last nights action was indicator. I posted 2970 must hold and we plunged 50 pts as soon as it broke then rallied to back-test. Key lvl today: If it can recapture 3120 still in play. Fail of overnight low though &amp; 2860-80 next where I'd play a bounce https://t.co/cFz2Lcj3yp
