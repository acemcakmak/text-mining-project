$-1272.28. Jumped the gun on $UAL at the open. Cut losses only to see it make a $2move. Should've waited for a clear signal. Don't be impulsive. Was down -$2K with other losses. Made back some with $CX at EOD. $AMD $MSFT $AAL $BAC #tradingpsychology #stocks #daytrading #Daytrader https://t.co/JInWWFyAzq
