@dhovekamp42 @ScottGottliebMD @WSJ I wouldn't be so literal. Gottlieb knows that cross-national collaboration is the best route. He's on the board of $PFE which has it's own C19 vaccine collaboration with Germany's BioNTech. Gottlieb is really referring to having sufficient national vaccine capacity and expertise.
