$SPX, a must-see. 4h on the left, daily on the right. 50% nonlogarithmic retracement in green. Such multi-timeframe analysis will help signal a high probability bearish entry. RSI is already there on the 4h, but yet to hit 70 on the daily. We'll likely see two red volume opens. https://t.co/1XhbOf6We8
